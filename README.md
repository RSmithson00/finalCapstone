# finalCapstone

A repo highlighting the Capstone projects completed during my HyperionDev Bootcamp in Data Science Fundamentals.

## financecalculators.py

This project allows a user to calculate more fine-grained payments for mortgages and returns on investments. By using several user-inputted variables, simple maths is used to determine a final returned variable. This project was made before I learnt about user-defined functions, and so in future I will simplify the code through user-defined functions.

## NLP Applications

This project takes textual data of Amazon reviews, analyses it for sentiment and polarity, and allows you to compare two reviews using SpaCy. This project needs some work.
